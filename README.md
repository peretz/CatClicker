# JavaScript Design Patterns: Exercise - Cat clicking app.

This exercise is part of Udacity's JavaScript Design Patterns course. The objective of this exercise
is learning the basic concepts around organizing scalable and maintainable code, which includes:

* Separation of concerns among displaying, processing and storing the data.
* The Model-View-Octopus design pattern (Octopus can be replaced with a Controller, ViewModel, or other component).
* Refactoring approaches.

In order to learn these concepts, the project iteratively implements a vanilla JavaScript/JQuery app where we have a list of
cats and we can select the image of each one of them. Then, we can keep track of how many clicks each image has received.

## File Structure.

There are two main files:

* *index.hmtl:* Contains a generic structure of the website.
* *script.js:* Contains the model and the octopus info.

## Displaying the app in your browser

1. Open the index.html file in your browser (e.g. file://your-local-path/index.html).
